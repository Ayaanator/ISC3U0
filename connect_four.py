"""This program plays connect four on the terminal.
The goal of the game is to connect four of the same coins in a row.
This can be done vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.
Coins are placed on top of previously placed coins.
If a column is full, you cannot place a coin there.
If all columns are full and there isn't four in a row, it is a tie.
